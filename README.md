# Effective Programming Interview

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Effective Programming Interview** repository! This repository contains the code solutions for problems discussed in the book "Elements of Programming Interviews for C++". It is designed to help you practice and prepare for technical interviews, particularly in the context of software engineering and computer science.

## Book Overview

"Elements of Programming Interviews" is a comprehensive guide that focuses on preparing candidates for technical interviews in the field of programming. The book covers various algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques commonly encountered during interviews. It emphasizes the use of the C++ programming language and provides detailed explanations and analysis of each problem.

## Repository Contents

This repository provides code solutions for the problems discussed in the book. Each problem has its dedicated folder, which contains the necessary C++ files to solve the problem. The code is organized in a logical manner, following the structure of the book.

The repository is structured as follows:

```
- Chapter01/
  - Problem01/
    - solution.cpp
    - test.cpp
  - Problem02/
    - solution.cpp
    - test.cpp
  ...
- Chapter02/
  ...
- Chapter03/
  ...
...
```

In this structure, each chapter is represented by a directory (`Chapter01`, `Chapter02`, etc.). Inside each chapter directory, you will find subdirectories for each problem (`Problem01`, `Problem02`, etc.). Each problem directory contains two important files:

1. `solution.cpp`: This file contains the code solution for the problem. It is recommended to read and understand the solution before attempting to write your own.
2. `test.cpp`: This file contains test cases to validate the correctness of the solution. It is a good practice to run the provided tests and potentially add your own test cases to ensure your solution is robust.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/effective-programming-interview.git
```

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can then navigate to the specific problem folder and compile the solution and test files using the appropriate compiler command.

For example, if you're using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), you can compile the files using the following command:

```
g++ solution.cpp -o solution
g++ test.cpp -o test
```

After successful compilation, you can run the executables to see the output of the solution and run the test cases, respectively.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have additional solutions, optimizations, or new problems to add, feel free to submit a pull request. Please make sure to follow the existing structure and include appropriate documentation and test cases for the added code.
